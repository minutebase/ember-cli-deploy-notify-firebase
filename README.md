> An ember-cli-deploy plugin to update a path in Firebase on activation

[![](https://ember-cli-deploy.github.io/ember-cli-deploy-version-badges/plugins/ember-cli-deploy-notify-firebase.svg)](http://ember-cli-deploy.github.io/ember-cli-deploy-version-badges/)

This plugin updates a path in Firebase with the latest version information when the deploy is activated.

## Why would I want to do that?

The main use-case is to display a notification to your users when a version changes so they can reload to get changes.

## What is an ember-cli-deploy plugin?

A plugin is an addon that can be executed as a part of the ember-cli-deploy pipeline. A plugin will implement one or more of the ember-cli-deploy's pipeline hooks.

For more information on what plugins are and how they work, please refer to the [Plugin Documentation][1].

## Quick Start
To get up and running quickly, do the following:

- Ensure [ember-cli-deploy-build][2] is installed and configured.

- Install this plugin

```bash
$ ember install ember-cli-deploy-notify-firebase
```

- Place the following configuration into `config/deploy.js`

```javascript
ENV.firebase {
  app: '<your-firebase-app>',
  token: '<your-firebase-token>'
}
```

- Run the pipeline & activate a deploy

```bash
$ ember deploy --activate
```

or

```bash
$ ember deploy
$ ember activate <version>
```

## Installation
Run the following command in your terminal:
